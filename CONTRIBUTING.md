Submitting Changes
------------------

Before submitting your [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests),
please make sure that the coding standards are respected and that all tests are passing. 

Pull requests should provide an overview of the changes made so it is clear what you are trying to achieve, this will help us when reviewing your changes.

Commit messages should be clear, we don't mind one-line messages for small changes 
but larger changes should follow [The Seven Rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) set by Chris Beams. 

We don't mind squashing small changes to tidy things up but please don't squash an entire branch as this can hinder code reviews.
